# hello-world
first github repository

Hi All, 
   Joel here.   Like many folks I found myself laid off due to the pandemic.  I decided when I got laid off that instead of going back into business administration I wanted to make a career change to IT.   I spent a good amount of time learning about AWS and getting my CCP and then my CSAA.   Now that those are taken care of I'm devoting my time to learning python.
